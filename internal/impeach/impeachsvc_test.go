// router, so its DB DELETE is a MISSED ROOT — present in the graph, reachable
// from no discovered entrypoint, and DISCLOSED BY NOTHING (no blind spot, no
// frontier marker). That is the genuine analyzer blind spot the cell must catch,
// and the seam this whole fixture exists to manufacture inside a boundary we
// control independent of the test.
