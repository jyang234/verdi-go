// Severance localization (plan §6) answers WHERE the static over-approximation
// lost the observed effect, by projecting the observed (entry → effect) path onto
// the graph and finding where static cannot reproduce it. It resolves at the
// highest level the corpus supports (§7 harness levels): L0 uses only the entry and
// effect anchors (coarse), L1 also maps the causal path's internal spans through
// their `flowmap.fqn` tags to a PRECISE node. The result is a Site plus the
// known/unknown frontier sort (§6) — disclosure-only at this phase, never enacted
// (the repair-writing loop is Phase 4, §8).
//
// Soundness is INVARIANT across levels (§7): a coarser level yields a coarser Site,
// never a wrong one — every anchor is a real graph node (or the entry registration
// literal), and the proof obligation refuses to fabricate a seam where none exists.
// The Kind and the proof obligation are computed by ONE shared mechanism (localize)
// for both levels, so they can never disagree on capture richness; only the Site's
// resolution changes. Precision is a dial; soundness is invariant.
