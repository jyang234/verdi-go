// the function emitting an effect — a rename, an extract-function, or a
// consolidation pointing several callers at one helper — leaves the target set
// unchanged and must NOT read as a breaking contract change (the same class as
// R10: keying on node identity, not the contract). A target that genuinely
// leaves the branch entirely still BLOCKs.
