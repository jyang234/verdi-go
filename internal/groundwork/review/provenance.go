// computed over a base/branch pair. The branch's caveats are the provenance of
// the code under review; when the two sides were built on different algorithms — or
// by different flowmap builds — a synthesized caveat discloses the mismatch, because
// a delta computed across substrates OR across producer versions can move for reasons
// that are the analyzer's/tool's, not the code's. Nil when neither side recorded
