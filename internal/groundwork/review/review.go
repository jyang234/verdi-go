// Review computes the MR review artifact from the base and branch graphs under a
// policy. It is a pure function: identical inputs always yield an identical
// artifact, digest included — which is what makes the verdict a hard, repeatable
// gate rather than an opinion.
//
// The graphs MUST come from trusted CI (flowmap run on the respective code). An
// agent that supplies its own branch graph forges any verdict by omitting an
// edge; groundwork cannot detect that, and does not try to — the trust boundary
// is around graph generation, not here.
