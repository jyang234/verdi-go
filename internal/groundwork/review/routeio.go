// RouteIODelta is one route whose external write surface changed base→branch —
// the per-route attribution the global io_effects diff cannot give. The
// load-bearing case is the LOST write: a route that reached an effect in base
// and no longer does, while the global effect set is unchanged because another
// route still reaches it — invisible to every other section. The disappearance
// of a write that was there is deterministic in a way the absence of a write
// that never was cannot be.
//
// A nil Base side means the route is new on the branch; a nil Branch side means
// it was removed (one-sided rows exist so a renamed route shows its counts —
// the rename itself already fires a breaking entrypoint contract change).
