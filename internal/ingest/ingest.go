// Package ingest groups a flat set of post-hoc spans (decoded from an OTLP/JSON
// trace export) into per-flow, per-service CapturedFlows ready for the existing
// canonicalizer — the out-of-process analog of the in-process harness's
// scope-and-assemble step (capture.Scope, post-hoc design [P10.2]).
//
// Two reductions of the same spans serve two consumers (design D-PH1): the
// assertion/coverage unit is the flow slug (a withFlow block can issue several
// requests, each rooting its own trace, so a slug spans multiple traces), and a
// representative trace is the diagram unit. This package produces the per-slug,
// per-service fragments; the caller canonicalizes and unions them.
//
// Per design D-PH4 a cross-service trace is split by service.name, so each
// service is validated against its own spans and owns its own golden. A
// fragment's entry is the span whose parent lives outside the fragment (an
// inbound server/consumer span, or — for a publisher-only service with no
// inbound span — a synthesized internal root, flagged so the caller can warn).
