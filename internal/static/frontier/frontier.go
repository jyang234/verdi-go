// Package frontier classifies a built call graph's FRONTIER — every place static
// reachability stops being able to answer — into the taxonomy from
// docs/design/frontier-instrumentation-plan.md, deterministically and with no
// coupling to any verdict surface (rule R3: a frontier label can only
// (mis)prioritize our own work, never change a fitness/verify result).
//
// It is intentionally free of any serialization type: it takes a minimal Input,
// not a graphio.Graph, so the analysis does not depend on the producer's schema —
// graphio imports frontier (to embed the section), never the reverse.
//
// The four bins:
//
//	A  — truly dynamic: resolved only at runtime (<dynamic> bus/HTTP targets,
//	     reflection, cgo/unsafe/linkname). Irreducible statically; disclose.
//	B  — reclaimable structure: statically determined AND reconnectable by a known
//	     reclaimer (the strict-server `$1` dispatch seam; a route whose cone is
//	     starved of every effect). The static lever — a sound reclaimer ADDS the
//	     missing edge. A severed closure no reclaimer recognizes (an errgroup or
//	     constructor closure dispatched through a struct field) is NOT B: it is
//	     disclosed as A, so the frontier never promises a reclaim `--reclaim` cannot
//	     perform (§21.②).
//	B2 — consumer-reclaimable: opaque only because the SOURCE is non-constant (a
//	     `db ExecContext` from runtime-built SQL). It splits in two (plan §2):
//	       B2a — accumulator-reclaimable by the maintainer-side SQL const-fold
//	             (--reclaim-sql): a constant statement laundered through a builder.
//	             Once folded it gains a readable verb and LEAVES the frontier, so it
//	             is visible as the drop in the opaque-db count, not a standing marker.
//	       B2b — genuinely consumer-reclaimable: a dynamic verb or a runtime
//	             identifier spliced into the text, which the fold cannot recover. In
//	             a folded graph the remaining opaque-db markers ARE the B2b residue.
//	C  — over-approximation: sound but imprecise (HighFanOut shared dispatch). Not
//	     blindness; precision.
