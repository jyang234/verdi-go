// Mermaid renderers for the component (C3) rollup — the human-readable sibling of the
// rollup JSON, a VIEW and never a gate (like the call-graph Mermaid). The encoding
// separates the two things a reviewer must not conflate:
//   - SHAPE carries an edge's CLASS: a solid arrow is a statically resolved
//     call/effect (code), a dashed arrow is a disclosed-but-blind effect.
//   - In the diff, COLOR + a ±-prefix carry an edge's delta STATE (added/removed/kept).
//
// Shape and state are independent, so "a newly DOCUMENTED blind effect" (a dashed
// green edge) never reads the same as "a new real dependency" (a solid green edge) —
// the same code-vs-disclosure honesty the JSON diff enforces, made legible.
