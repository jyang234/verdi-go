// Package promote implements salience filtering as tree contraction (canon spec
// §3.7, plan [C3]). Dropping a sub-threshold internal node is not a delete: the
// node's surviving child-groups are spliced into its parent at the node's own
// position, so order and concurrency membership are preserved. The root (the
// tier-1 entry) is never dropped.
//
// Two shapes matter, both exercised by the fixture:
//   - A sole sequential wrapper (the tier-3 evaluator) is removed and its
//     child-groups take its slot — a concurrent pair under the wrapper surfaces
//     as a concurrent group directly under the root.
//   - A concurrent member that is itself a thin wrapper (the tier-3 scorer around
//     the tier-1 credit-bureau call) is removed and its child promoted into the
//     concurrent group, so the surviving pair stays a race.
