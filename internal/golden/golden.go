// Package golden is the snapshot-assertion lifecycle behind the behavioral gate
// (golden-diff spec, canon spec §6). It compares a freshly canonicalized trace to
// the committed golden IR and, under -update, rewrites both the golden JSON and
// the rendered Mermaid view. Equality ignores the Discards manifest — it records
// only what was dropped, for review transparency, and must never perturb the
// gate.
//
// The assertion is on the IR, not the Mermaid: the diagram is a committed view
// derived from the IR, so a renderer change can never cause a false golden.
