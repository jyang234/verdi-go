# These goldens are the *input* to groundwork's tests: groundwork consumes
# flowmap's graph JSON, so its fixtures are graphs, not source. We commit the
# source modules too (for provenance and so a flowmap change that shifts the
# graph shape is caught here, the same discipline flowmap uses for its boundary
# contract). Run from the repo root after changing a fixture or the graph schema:
#
#     go run ./cmd/flowmap >/dev/null   # ensure it builds
#     testdata/groundwork/regen.sh
#     git diff testdata/groundwork/goldens   # review the delta

# loansvc is flowmap's richer fixture; we keep a copy of its graph as a groundwork
# golden purely so the effect-label contract test (review) sees the full label
# vocabulary the classifiers depend on — db read/write, bus publish/consume, and
# outbound GET/POST. If flowmap's label format ever changes, regenerating this is
# what makes the contract test fail instead of silently misclassifying effects.

# added (additive), and a new outbound dependency (informational).

# Branch goldens for the review demo. groundwork's `review` compares a base graph
# to a branch graph; in CI both come from flowmap run on the respective code. Here
# we synthesize the branch graphs by applying one documented feature delta to the
# real layeredsvc base — "add a GetUserFast read endpoint" — wired two ways:
#
#   branch-good: GetUserFast → app.GetProfile   (handler → app: correct)
#   branch-skip: GetUserFast → store.SelectUser (handler → store: skips the app layer)
#
# Same feature, same description; the only difference is one edge. That is exactly
# what flowmap would emit for the two source variants, and it is what makes the
# review verdict (STRUCTURALLY-CLEAR vs BLOCK) a property of the code, not the prose.
