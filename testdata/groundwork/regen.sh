# Regenerate the committed groundwork graph goldens from the fixture services.
#
# These goldens are the *input* to groundwork's tests: groundwork consumes
# flowmap's graph JSON, so its fixtures are graphs, not source. We commit the
# source modules too (for provenance and so a flowmap change that shifts the
# graph shape is caught here, the same discipline flowmap uses for its boundary
# contract). Run from the repo root after changing a fixture or the graph schema:
#
#     go run ./cmd/flowmap >/dev/null   # ensure it builds
#     testdata/groundwork/regen.sh
#     git diff testdata/groundwork/goldens   # review the delta
#
# Section counts are pinned in goldens/manifest.json, which this script
# deliberately does NOT rewrite: if a regen changes a section's size, the
# manifest test fails until you update the manifest by hand in the same
# commit — the ratchet that keeps a regen from laundering an analyzer
# regression into the goldens (it happened once: see
# TestGoldenSectionManifest).

# flowmap stamps the build that produced the graph into the header (the `tool`
# producer field, R11). Strip it from the committed goldens: like the --stamp code
# identity, the producing-tool version is provenance that must NOT pollute a golden,
# or the fixtures would churn every time a different flowmap build regenerated them.
# Delete the key JSON-aware (pop, not a line-grep) so the strip cannot silently miss
# the field if canonjson's formatting (indent width, key position) ever shifts, then
# re-emit in canonjson's exact shape — 2-space indent, non-ASCII kept literal
# (ensure_ascii=False), trailing newline — so the golden stays byte-identical to
# `flowmap graph` output minus the one field. The round-trip preserves key order
# (json.load/dump keep insertion order = canonjson's struct order).

# Branch goldens for the review demo. groundwork's `review` compares a base graph
# to a branch graph; in CI both come from flowmap run on the respective code. Here
# we synthesize the branch graphs by applying one documented feature delta to the
# real layeredsvc base — "add a GetUserFast read endpoint" — wired two ways:
#
#   branch-good: GetUserFast → app.GetProfile   (handler → app: correct)
#   branch-skip: GetUserFast → store.SelectUser (handler → store: skips the app layer)
#
# Same feature, same description; the only difference is one edge. That is exactly
# what flowmap would emit for the two source variants, and it is what makes the
# review verdict (STRUCTURALLY-CLEAR vs BLOCK) a property of the code, not the prose.
