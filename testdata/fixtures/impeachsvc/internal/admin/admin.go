// Package admin is an internal maintenance sub-app mounted on the custom router.
// It models two patterns common in real services that make static attribution
// hard: a FACTORY that builds handlers over injected dependencies, and a DYNAMIC
// ROUTE TABLE assembled at runtime rather than spelled out as literal
// registration calls. The handlers are named method values (not $N closures), so
// they draw no severed-closure frontier marker; mounted through the custom
// (unhinted) router, they are missed roots. PurgeLedger reaches a real DB DELETE.
