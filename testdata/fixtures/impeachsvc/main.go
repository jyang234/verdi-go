// Command impeachsvc is a fixture whose purpose is to make the static analyzer's
// own blind spot CONCRETE and behaviorally catchable. It wires two route
// surfaces:
//
//   - a PUBLIC route registered through net/http's recognized HandleFunc
//     (POST /loan -> handler.App.Create -> DB INSERT loans): a discovered
//     entrypoint whose effect is soundly attributed;
//   - an ADMIN sub-app mounted through a bespoke custom router via a factory +
//     dynamic route table (DELETE /admin/ledger -> admin.Admin.PurgeLedger ->
//     DB DELETE ledger): a MISSED ROOT. The builder still reaches PurgeLedger
//     from main (the handler value is address-taken in the router's map), so the
//     DELETE effect is in the graph — but no discovered entrypoint owns it and
//     nothing discloses the gap.
//
// Driven behaviorally, the DELETE is observed on a path the static graph cannot
// attribute to any route: a genuine impeachment of the analyzer's route→effect
// completeness, caught with a runtime witness.
