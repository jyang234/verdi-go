// Package harness is flowmap's PUBLIC in-process capture harness: a target
// service repository imports it to drive one flow through its real router (or
// consumer path) under a fully-instrumented OpenTelemetry pipeline and hand the
// captured trace to canonicalization (trace-capture-harness spec). It wires the
// real OTel SDK with an in-memory recorder, AlwaysSample, and a baggage→attribute
// processor so every span is attributable to exactly one test run, then waits for
// quiescence and refuses to surface a truncated trace.
//
// This package is part of the stable public surface (plan [C1]); its exported
// types are the consumer contract. Internally it adapts real OTel spans into the
// OTel-free public capture model (package capture, decision D8), so
// canonicalization and everything downstream never import OTel.
