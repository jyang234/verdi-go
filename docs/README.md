# Documentation map

> **`ACTIVE`** · index for the docs space · _reviewed 2026-06-13_

This is the front door to `docs/`. The tree is organized by **role**, and every
doc carries a lifecycle banner directly under its title so you can tell at a
glance what is current and what is kept for history.

## Lifecycle legend

Every doc header begins with one of:

| Badge | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **`ACTIVE`** | Current and in active use — the usage guides, the specs/deep-dive reference, and design docs still awaiting implementation. Trust it; keep it current. |
| **`DESIGN RECORD`** | The work it describes has shipped. Kept for the rationale, decisions, and pressure-test trail — not a to-do list. Accurate as history, not necessarily a guide to today's surface. |
| **`HISTORICAL`** | Superseded — its content has been folded into a spec or refined into a plan. Kept only for the reasoning that produced what replaced it. Do not treat as current. |

## specs/ — component specifications · **`ACTIVE`**

The assembled-system contract and the seven component specs. Start here for "how
the system actually works."

| Doc | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [`scope-enforcement-guarantees.md`](specs/scope-enforcement-guarantees.md) | The capstone — what the assembled system is, how it's enforced, and what it does *not* guarantee. Read this first. |
| [`static-extractor-spec.md`](specs/static-extractor-spec.md) | The static pipeline: call graph → inter-service boundary contract + blind-spot manifest. |
| [`tier-map-spec.md`](specs/tier-map-spec.md) | The single salience classifier both pipelines call to assign `Tier`. |
| [`trace-canonicalization-spec.md`](specs/trace-canonicalization-spec.md) | The deterministic transform from a raw OTel trace to a run-independent snapshot. |
| [`trace-capture-harness-spec.md`](specs/trace-capture-harness-spec.md) | Producing canonicalization's input: a complete, scoped trace for one flow. |
| [`golden-diff-spec.md`](specs/golden-diff-spec.md) | Golden files and the semantic, prioritized behavioral diff. |

## guides/ — how-to · **`ACTIVE`**

| Doc | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [`adopting-flowmap.md`](guides/adopting-flowmap.md) | End-to-end recipe for wiring flowmap **and groundwork** into a Go service and across the lifecycle (design/build/review/triage). |
| [`rule-anchoring.md`](guides/rule-anchoring.md) | Authoring `must-precede` obligations across a dispatch boundary. |
| [`integration/README.md`](guides/integration/README.md) | Conventions + copy-ready scaffolding for an out-of-process e2e suite. |
| [`integration/otlp-integration-guide.md`](guides/integration/otlp-integration-guide.md) | Step-by-step for adding post-hoc capture to an existing OTLP e2e suite. |

## groundwork/ — the verification layer

The deterministic consumer of flowmap's graph. A mix of active guides and the
design record behind them.

| Doc | Status | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| [`README.md`](groundwork/README.md) | `ACTIVE` | Overview + index into the design record. |
| [`usage.md`](groundwork/usage.md) | `ACTIVE` | Practical guide: commands and a worked review. |
| [`agent-workflow.md`](groundwork/agent-workflow.md) | `ACTIVE` | Harness-neutral guidance for orchestrating the MCP tools from a coding agent (the ground → edit → verify loop). |
| [`personas.md`](groundwork/personas.md) | `ACTIVE` | Before/after for the responder, developer, and reviewer. |
| [`distilled-learnings.md`](groundwork/distilled-learnings.md) | `DESIGN RECORD` | The thesis and what was established about the substrate. |
| [`mr-review-artifacts.md`](groundwork/mr-review-artifacts.md) | `DESIGN RECORD` | The unfakeable MR review artifact design. |
| [`pressure-test.md`](groundwork/pressure-test.md) | `DESIGN RECORD` | Adversarial pressure test of the central claims. |
| [`implementation-plan.md`](groundwork/implementation-plan.md) | `DESIGN RECORD` | Plan-of-record for building groundwork (built). |
| [`drills.md`](groundwork/drills.md) | `DESIGN RECORD` | Triage effectiveness, measured as committed tests — the evidence record. |
| [`scorecard.md`](groundwork/scorecard.md) | `DESIGN RECORD` | Honest capability assessment, graded by evidence class. |

## design/ — plans & briefs

Feature plans and design briefs. Most describe shipped work and are kept as the
decision record; a few are still in flight.

| Doc | Status | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| [`correctness-expansion-plan.md`](design/correctness-expansion-plan.md) | `ACTIVE` | The correctness (CX) expansion; the CX-5 gate is the one phase still awaiting implementation. |
| [`behavioral-impeachment-plan.md`](design/behavioral-impeachment-plan.md) | `DESIGN RECORD` | Joining the static graph with captured behavior to find counterexamples to the analyzer's own negatives (the impeachment cell). Loop closed: Phases 0–5 shipped behind a default-off opt-in and proven end-to-end on the `impeachsvc` fixture (incl. a recorded pressure test). |
| [`flowmap-capability-headroom.md`](design/flowmap-capability-headroom.md) | `PROPOSAL` | Headroom pass on flowmap's *scope* (not its soundness): schema-drift cross-check (prototyped), effect-kind recognizers, value-flow/taint (PoC). Ranked by soundness × utility; substrate claims verified against pin `85ca0a9`. |
| [`schema-drift-check-plan.md`](design/schema-drift-check-plan.md) | `DESIGN RECORD` | §1 of the headroom analysis, **shipped** as `internal/static/schemadrift` + `flowmap schema-drift`: a post-process diffing IR db-write labels against the migration-defined schema (Flyway ∪ library-owned), with `--gate` and build-fresh. Kept for the soundness/completeness contract. |
| [`frontier-instrumentation-plan.md`](design/frontier-instrumentation-plan.md) | `PROPOSAL` | Measuring and reclaiming the static frontier. Components 1–3 shipped (the `flowmap frontier` classifier, structured frontier disclosure, and the opt-in `internal/static/reclaim` edge reclaimers); only the fenced trace lane remains deferred. |
| [`sql-constfold-reclaim-plan.md`](design/sql-constfold-reclaim-plan.md) | `DESIGN RECORD` | The SQL-label analogue of the frontier edge reclaimer, **shipped** opt-in as `internal/static/sqlfold` (`flowmap graph --reclaim-sql`): folds constant-fragment SQL builders so a write's table resolves to its proven constant set, abstaining on every completeness gap. |
| [`correctness-field-run.md`](design/correctness-field-run.md) | `DESIGN RECORD` | Protocol for the 2026-06-12 field measurement run. |
| [`cx5-chains-surface.md`](design/cx5-chains-surface.md) | `DESIGN RECORD` | The shipped cross-service chain surface (observational; the gate is unbuilt). |
| [`cx5-inputs-response.md`](design/cx5-inputs-response.md) | `DESIGN RECORD` | The field response feeding CX-5, recorded and independently verified. |
| [`implementation_plan.md`](design/implementation_plan.md) | `DESIGN RECORD` | The original flowmap phased plan; v1 core (Phases 0–8) shipped. |
| [`post-hoc-behavioral-ingestion.md`](design/post-hoc-behavioral-ingestion.md) | `DESIGN RECORD` | Post-hoc (`ModePostHoc`) ingestion brief; stages 1–2 landed. |
| [`guardrail-extensions-plan.md`](design/guardrail-extensions-plan.md) | `DESIGN RECORD` | Deterministic guardrail extensions GX-1..5 (shipped). |
| [`path-obligations-plan.md`](design/path-obligations-plan.md) | `DESIGN RECORD` | Path-obligation checks OB-0..3 (shipped). |
| [`incident-triage-plan.md`](design/incident-triage-plan.md) | `DESIGN RECORD` | Incident triage IT-0..4 (shipped). |
| [`mcp-expansion-plan.md`](design/mcp-expansion-plan.md) | `DESIGN RECORD` | MCP tiers 2–3 (all built). |
| [`policy-coverage-extensions-plan.md`](design/policy-coverage-extensions-plan.md) | `DESIGN RECORD` | Policy coverage extensions PC-1..3 (shipped; PC-4 parked). |
| [`review-fixes-plan.md`](design/review-fixes-plan.md) | `DESIGN RECORD` | The branch-wide review fixes RF-1..7 (shipped). |
| [`wrapper-fanout-investigation.md`](design/wrapper-fanout-investigation.md) | `HISTORICAL` | Exploratory HighFanOut investigation (D-CX10); conclusions folded into `rule-anchoring` + the `--algo` flag. |
| [`cx5-inputs-request.md`](design/cx5-inputs-request.md) | `HISTORICAL` | Exploratory field-input request, now answered by `cx5-inputs-response`. |

## archive/ — superseded · **`HISTORICAL`**

| Doc | Why it's here |
|---|---|
| [`consistency-pass.md`](archive/consistency-pass.md) | A design-consistency sweep whose findings and corrections are now folded into the specs. Kept for the reasoning trail. |
