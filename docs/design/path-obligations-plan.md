# path obligations: implementation plan

**Status:** plan-of-record, refined from
[`ideas/path-obligations.md`](ideas/path-obligations.md). Grounded in the actual
code (file references verified), not just the idea doc.

Scope decisions made when this plan was cut:

- **D-OB1 — both obligation kinds in slice 1**: `must-release` *and*
  `must-precede`. They share all infrastructure (config, analysis package,
  graph.json section, fixture, groundwork plumbing), and `must-precede` is the
  dominance machinery the incident-triage plan's partial-effect check depends on
  (see [`incident-triage-plan.md`](incident-triage-plan.md), Phase IT-3).
- **D-OB2 — rules live in `.flowmap.yaml`**: evaluation stays where the SSA
  lives (flowmap, the trusted CI side); the rules ride the same
  CODEOWNERS-gated document as the classify hints. groundwork never sees rules,
  only findings.
- **D-OB3 — sequencing**: this lands before the incident-triage work.

---

## 1. A correction to the idea doc

The idea doc calls both checks "dominator-tree queries". Only one is:

- **must-precede** ("every B site is dominated by an A site") *is* a pure
  dominance query — `ssa.BasicBlock.Dominates` / the dominator tree SSA already
  computes.
- **must-release** ("after an acquire, every path to exit hits a release") is
  **not** dominance; it is a forward CFG reachability question: *is any function
  exit reachable from the acquire block without passing a release site?* — with
  `defer`-crediting (a release registered via `defer` before the path covers
  every later exit). Same substrate (`ssa.Function.Blocks`), same determinism,
  different walk.

Both remain simple, deterministic, and intraprocedural. This changes
implementation shape only, not feasibility or cost.

## 2. The interface (verified facts)

- flowmap already builds full SSA: `internal/static/ssabuild/ssabuild.go:30-36`
  (`ssautil.Packages(..., ssa.InstantiateGenerics); prog.Build()`); every
  call-graph node carries its `*ssa.Function`
  (`internal/static/callgraph/callgraph.go`). The CFGs exist; nothing new is
  constructed.
- `.flowmap.yaml` is loaded with `KnownFields(true)` and a `validate()` pass
  (`internal/config/config.go:206-256`) — a typo'd obligation key fails loudly,
  matching the existing discipline.
- graph.json is emitted by `internal/static/graphio/graphio.go` and decoded by
  groundwork with `DisallowUnknownFields`
  (`internal/groundwork/graph/graph.go:84-95`). **A new `obligations` section is
  therefore a lockstep change**: graphio emit + groundwork decode + golden
  regeneration (`testdata/groundwork/regen.sh`) land in the same commit, which
  is exactly what the strict decoder is for.
- groundwork findings are two-severity (`Violation` fails the gate, `Caution` is
  the legible abstention — `internal/groundwork/fitness/result.go:9-24`), and
  `review`/`verify` already diff findings base-vs-branch by key and report only
  new ones (`internal/groundwork/review/review.go:59-84`). Obligation findings
  flow through unchanged.

## 3. Config schema

Extend `Config` (`internal/config/config.go`) with an ordered slice (never a
map):

```yaml
obligations:
  - name: tx-must-close            # required, unique
    acquire: "example.com/svc/internal/store#BeginTx"
    release:
      - "example.com/svc/internal/store#Commit"
      - "example.com/svc/internal/store#Rollback"
  - name: audit-before-publish
    require: "example.com/svc/internal/audit#Write"
    before:  "example.com/svc/internal/eventbus#Publish"
```

- Kind is inferred from the fields: `acquire`/`release` ⇒ must-release,
  `require`/`before` ⇒ must-precede. Mixing the two field sets in one rule is a
  validation error, as is an empty `release` list or a missing `name`.
- FQN syntax is the existing `import/path#Symbol` form the classify hints use —
  one notation across the document.

## 4. The analysis: `internal/static/obligations`

A new package, pure function of (`*ssa.Function`, rules) → findings. No global
state, no interprocedural reasoning in slice 1.

**Site discovery.** For each function in the call graph, scan call instructions
for acquire / release / require / before targets (matching the rule FQNs the
same way the classify-hint matcher does). Functions with no relevant site
produce nothing — the common case, so cost is near zero on rule-free services.

**must-release.** For each acquire site: walk forward over `Blocks` from the
acquire instruction; a path is *covered* if it passes a release call or a
`defer` of a release that was registered before the exit. If a function exit
(`return`, explicit `panic`) is reachable uncovered → `VIOLATED`, with the
uncovered exit's position as the witness. Implicit runtime panics are ignored
(standard practice for lifecycle checkers — `sqlclosecheck` does the same).

**must-precede.** For each `before` (B) site: `SATISFIED` iff some `require` (A)
site dominates it (A in a dominating block, or earlier in the same block).
Otherwise `VIOLATED`, naming the undominated B site.

**Abstention (`CANT-PROVE`) triggers — disclosed, never silent:**

- the acquired value escapes the function: returned, stored to a heap object,
  or passed to a first-party callee (release-in-callee is the interprocedural
  case slice 1 does not attempt);
- `recover` is present (control rejoins invisibly);
- the CFG is irreducible.

**Determinism.** Findings sorted by (rule, fn FQN, site position); positions are
`file.go:line` from the SSA instruction, stable across runs — same property the
rest of the pipeline already guarantees, so the artifact digest stays stable.

## 5. graph.json: the `obligations` section

A separate, FQN-keyed disclosure section (the sanctioned "narrow level-2 slice"
form), not folded into call-graph edges:

```json
"obligations": [
  {"rule": "tx-must-close", "kind": "must-release",
   "fn": "example.com/svc/internal/store.Transfer", "site": "store.go:42",
   "status": "VIOLATED", "detail": "exit at store.go:48 reachable without release"},
  {"rule": "audit-before-publish", "kind": "must-precede",
   "fn": "example.com/svc/internal/app.Disburse", "site": "app.go:91",
   "status": "SATISFIED"}
]
```

**D-OB4 — emit all three statuses, including SATISFIED.** SATISFIED is the
valuable universal ("no modeled path leaks") and emitting it is what makes the
drift ratchet visible: a SATISFIED→VIOLATED flip shows up in the
base-vs-branch diff as a new violation, and the proof's existence is auditable
rather than implied by silence. The section is omitted entirely (`omitempty`)
when no rules are configured, so rule-free services see a byte-identical
graph.json.

## 6. groundwork: judging

- `graph.Graph` gains the `Obligations []Obligation` field (lockstep with
  graphio, §2).
- `fitness.Check` gains `checkObligations`: `VIOLATED` → `Violation`,
  `CANT-PROVE` → `Caution`, `SATISFIED` → no finding. Finding key =
  (rule, fn, site), so `review`/`verify`'s new-findings diff and the
  three-valued verdict need **zero changes**.
- A future `require_proof` escalation (CANT-PROVE → gate-failing for named
  rules) is policy-side and deliberately out of slice 1.

## 7. Fixture and tests

New fixture `testdata/groundwork/obligsvc` (sibling of `layeredsvc`/`blindsvc`),
with its golden graph wired into `regen.sh` and `cmd/groundwork/main_test.go`.
It exercises one case per verdict per kind:

| function | shape | expected |
|---|---|---|
| `Transfer` | acquire, error-return path with no release | must-release `VIOLATED` |
| `TransferDefer` | acquire + `defer Rollback()` | must-release `SATISFIED` |
| `TransferEscape` | acquire, tx passed to helper | must-release `CANT-PROVE` |
| `Disburse` | audit dominates publish | must-precede `SATISFIED` |
| `DisburseRacy` | publish on a branch with no audit | must-precede `VIOLATED` |

Unit tests in `internal/static/obligations` build SSA from inline source
snippets (table-driven), covering defer ordering, multi-exit, loops,
release-on-one-arm, and each abstention trigger.

## 8. Build order

- **Phase OB-0 — config.** `obligations:` schema + validation in
  `internal/config`. *Exit: malformed rules rejected with positional errors;
  valid rules round-trip.*
- **Phase OB-1 — analysis.** `internal/static/obligations` with both walks,
  unit-tested against inline-SSA tables. *Exit: every fixture-shape above
  verdicts correctly at the package level.*
- **Phase OB-2 — emission, lockstep.** Wire into
  `internal/static/analyze/analyze.go`; graphio emits `obligations`; groundwork
  decodes it; goldens regenerated. One commit. *Exit: `flowmap graph obligsvc`
  emits the section deterministically; groundwork loads it; rule-free services'
  graphs are byte-identical to before.*
- **Phase OB-3 — judging.** `fitness.checkObligations`; end-to-end
  `review`/`verify` on obligsvc base-vs-branch (introduce the leak in a branch
  fixture → BLOCK with exactly one new violation). *Exit: the worked example
  from the idea doc reproduces end-to-end.*

## 9. Honest limits (carried over, still true)

VIOLATED is existential modulo path feasibility — tune toward soundness and add
an allow-list (mirroring layering's) only when a real infeasible-path false
positive appears, not preemptively. No interprocedural, no concurrency, no
value semantics: the check proves the *shape* of a function's effect discipline
over all paths, nothing more. The ROI gate from the idea doc stands: if these
rules sit unconfigured on real services, the feature was speculative — the
fixture proves the machinery, adoption proves the value.
